# Hiya
I'm Rye (they/she)


I code for fun mostly. Most of my (probably private) projects are Linux-specific scripts I use daily (for example: status bars and windowmanager patches). Occasionally I attempt to make a game (and usually get quite bored of it).


# Languages I know:

- C, which I learned first, and use mostly for Linux scripts
- Rust, which I use for most other larger projects
- Lua, which I learned recently, and really enjoy (I use it for games now too, with LOVE2d game engine)

I also "know" several others, such as:

- C++, which is just worse C
- Python, which I despise
- C#, which I learned for the Godot game engine
- Common Lisp, which I enjoy, but have a hard time using

# Software I use:

- Neovim is my favourite editor, as I like having a good, light, terminal-based modal text editor, rather than an entire operating system (cough cough emacs)

- I use StumpWM as my main window manager, as I love the tiling style, and common lisp as a config language is quite useful

- Void Linux is my main Linux distro, although for special purposes I occasionally use Alpine and Gentoo. Sometimes for fun I'll use NetBSD/OpenBSD.
